title: Experiments
---

In this section, we validate the theoretical insights through practical experiments.  
We implemented and trained from scratch four models on the MNIST dataset:

- AutoEncoder (AE)
- Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)  
- Variational Sparse Coding (VSC)  
- Variational Sparse Coding with Warm-Up (VSC-WU)

All models share the same encoder/decoder structure: three convolutional layers with ReLU activations, ensuring a fair comparison by keeping the number of parameters approximately equal.
Each model was trained using the Adam optimizer over ? epochs.

## Latent Space Visualization

To qualitatively evaluate the structure of the latent space, we sample from a 2D grid of latent vectors.  
Each point is decoded to an image, providing insight into how the model organizes information in the latent space.

## Activated Dimensions

We visualize how each latent dimension is activated across the dataset categories.  
For each class (0 to 9), we compute the mean latent vector and display it as a heatmap.

This helps us identify how interpretable and sparse the representations are, especially for the VSC models.

## Reconstruction

Finally, we evaluate reconstruction quality by comparing recontructing original and noisy images.
This assesses both fidelity and robustness to perturbations.
