This repository contains the implementation of **Variational Sparse Coding (VSC)**, a variant of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that introduces sparsity in the latent space using a **Spike-and-Slab prior**. The project is part of a university course we had on high-dimensional statistics.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore **VSC** as a generative model that addresses key limitations of traditional VAEs, such as posterior collapse and lack of interpretability in the latent space. The implementation includes:

- **AutoEncoder (AE)**: Baseline model for dimensionality reduction.
- - **Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)**: Probabilistic extension of AE.
- **Variational Sparse Coding (VSC)**: Sparse latent space with disentangled features.
    - **VSC with Warm-Up (VSC-WU)**: Improved training strategy to avoid posterior collapse (ie. all the information collapse to a few dimensions).

## Pipeline

To run the project, use the following commands:

```bash
make pip          # Install dependencies
make download     # Download datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST)
make train        # Train the models
make graphics     # Generate visualizations
make update_web   # Build and update the online report
```
